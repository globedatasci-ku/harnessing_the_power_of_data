# Harnessing the power of data
In fall of 2021, we embarked on a semester-long, project-based arc in the working group to empower folks in R. Our goal is to get folks to move from the "I have a messy database, and my advisor told me I should learn R to analyse it. What do I do?" to generating organized data analysis projects in R.
